**##DATASET OVERVIEW**

The dataset was gotten from Kaggle, through Zion Tech-Hub mentorship program, it has information of sales and customer information from year 2015 to 2022.

I used Microsoft Excel and Power bi to carry out the exploratory data analysis and visualization.

The absence of data for years 2019 and 2020 is likely attributed to the significant disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The global crisis had far-reaching effects on businesses, potentially leading to data collection gaps during this period.
